 * `captureCollectedAddress` on settlement.
 *
 * They must never reach Cashfree. Pre-filling its form with a placeholder
 * invites the customer to leave it there — and an order carrying
 * `pending@checkout.ydurya` as its email can never be confirmed to anyone. Use
 * `isPlaceholder` to strip them before building a payment payload; Cashfree
 * accepts absent contact fields and renders them as empty inputs.
